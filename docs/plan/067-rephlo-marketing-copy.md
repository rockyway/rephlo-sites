## FAQ Content

### General Questions

**Q: What is Rephlo?**
```
A: Rephlo is an AI-powered writing assistant for Windows that works system-wide across all applications. Instead of copying text to ChatGPT or other tools, Rephlo lets you enhance text directly where you're working—in emails, documents, code editors, chat apps, and more. Simply select text, choose a command, and see AI-enhanced results instantly.
```

**Q: How much does Rephlo cost?**
```
A: Rephlo is currently free during beta. The free tier includes unlimited custom commands, system-wide text enhancement, and works with both cloud AI providers (100 transformations/month) and unlimited local AI via Ollama. Paid tiers with additional features will be introduced after the beta period.
```

**Q: What's the difference between Rephlo and ChatGPT/Claude?**
```
A: ChatGPT and Claude are chat interfaces where you copy text, paste it into their web app, wait for a response, then copy results back. Rephlo integrates directly into Windows, allowing you to transform text in-place without ever leaving your current application. Think of Rephlo as bringing ChatGPT-level intelligence directly into every app you use, with customizable commands tailored to your needs.
```

**Q: Does Rephlo replace Grammarly?**
```
A: Rephlo and Grammarly serve different purposes. Grammarly focuses on real-time grammar correction and writing suggestions, primarily in browsers. Rephlo is about on-demand AI transformation using large language models—rewriting, summarizing, tone adjustment, and custom transformations across all Windows applications. Many users use both: Grammarly for passive correction, Rephlo for active transformation.
```

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: What operating systems does Rephlo support?**
```
A: Rephlo currently supports Windows 10 (version 1809 or later) and Windows 11. Both 64-bit editions are supported. macOS and Linux versions are planned for future releases.
```

**Q: What applications does Rephlo work with?**
```
A: Rephlo works with 95%+ of Windows applications, including:
• Microsoft Office (Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel)
• Code editors (VS Code, Visual Studio, Sublime Text, Notepad++)
• Communication apps (Slack, Discord, Teams, Zoom chat)
• Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave)
• Text editors (Notepad, WordPad, any rich text editor)
• Any application where you can select text

The only exceptions are some legacy applications or highly customized UIs with non-standard text fields.
```

**Q: Does Rephlo work offline?**
```
A: Yes, when using Ollama (local AI models). Ollama runs entirely on your machine with no internet connection required, providing complete offline functionality. Cloud AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Groq) require an internet connection. You can switch between providers based on whether you're online or need offline capability.
```

**Q: What AI models does Rephlo support?**
```
A: Rephlo supports multiple AI providers:

Cloud Providers:
• Azure OpenAI: GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5
• Groq: Mixtral, Llama 3, and other models

Local Provider:
• Ollama: Llama 3, Mistral, CodeLlama, Phi-3, and 50+ other models

You can configure multiple providers and switch between them without restarting Rephlo.
```

**Q: How much RAM/system resources does Rephlo use?**
```
A: Rephlo is lightweight:
• Idle: <100MB RAM
• Active transformation: <250MB RAM peak
• CPU: <1% idle, <5% during processing
• Disk space: <50MB application, <10MB database

Local Ollama models require additional resources depending on the model size (typically 4-8GB RAM for smaller models, 16GB+ for larger models).
```

---

### Privacy & Security Questions

**Q: Is my data secure?**
```
A: Yes. Rephlo takes privacy seriously:

1. Zero Logging: We never log, store, or transmit your text to our servers
2. Local Processing Option: Use Ollama for complete on-device AI processing
3. Encrypted Storage: API keys encrypted with Windows DPAPI (AES-256)
4. No Telemetry: Zero analytics or usage tracking without explicit opt-in
5. Transparent Cloud Providers: When using cloud AI, we clearly indicate which provider processes your text

When text is sent to cloud providers, it's transmitted via HTTPS and subject to their privacy policies (Azure, Groq). We recommend Ollama for sensitive or confidential content.
```

**Q: Does Rephlo send my text to the internet?**
```
A: Only when using cloud AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Groq). When you select a command, the selected text is sent via encrypted HTTPS to the provider you've configured for AI processing, then discarded after receiving the response.

If you use Ollama (local AI), all processing happens entirely on your machine with zero network transmission. This is ideal for sensitive documents, proprietary code, or regulated industries.
```

**Q: Where are my API keys stored?**
```
A: API keys for cloud providers are encrypted and stored locally on your machine using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) with AES-256 encryption. Only your Windows user account can decrypt these keys. They are never transmitted to our servers or stored in the cloud.
```

**Q: Can I use Rephlo for confidential/proprietary work?**
```
A: Yes, with Ollama. Configure Rephlo to use local Ollama models, and all AI processing happens entirely on your machine. Your text never leaves your computer, making it suitable for:
• Confidential business documents
• Proprietary code and technical documents
• Regulated industries (healthcare, legal, finance)
• Government or military work with classification requirements
• Any sensitive content requiring air-gapped processing
```

---

### Usage Questions

**Q: How do I create a custom command?**
```
A: Creating commands is simple:

1. Open Rephlo from the system tray
2. Navigate to the "Commands" screen
3. Click "Add Command"
4. Enter a name (e.g., "Professional Email")
5. Write your instruction (e.g., "Rewrite this email in a professional, courteous tone")
6. Save

Your command now appears in the context menu when you select text. You can create unlimited commands for any writing task.
```

**Q: What are template variables?**
```
A: Template variables let you create dynamic commands:

• {{input_text}}: The text you selected
• {{space_data_all}}: Reference knowledge base from a Space
• {{space_data_id}}: Specific document from a Space

Example command:
"Rewrite {{input_text}} to match our style guide: {{space_data_all}}"

This allows contextual AI transformations using your own reference materials.
```

**Q: What are Spaces?**
```
A: Spaces are organizational containers for related Commands and reference materials. Think of them like folders or projects. You can:
• Group commands by role (Marketing, Development, Business)
• Upload reference documents (style guides, examples, templates)
• Share contexts across multiple commands
• Keep work separate from personal writing

Example: A "Marketing" Space might contain commands like "Blog Post Intro," "LinkedIn Post," and "Email Newsletter," all referencing the same brand guidelines document.
```

**Q: Can I use keyboard shortcuts instead of right-clicking?**
```
A: Yes! Rephlo supports global keyboard shortcuts:
• Ctrl+Shift+Space: Open context menu at cursor
• Customizable shortcuts (future feature)

All interactions also work with standard right-click context menu for flexibility.
```

---

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Rephlo context menu doesn't appear when I select text. Why?**
```
A: Common solutions:

1. Ensure Rephlo is running (check system tray for blue icon)
2. Hold Ctrl key while releasing mouse button after text selection
3. Try right-clicking selected text to see if menu appears
4. Check if the application is compatible (95%+ are, but some legacy apps may not work)
5. Restart Rephlo from the system tray menu

If issues persist, contact support@rephlo.io with the application name and Windows version.
```

**Q: My AI transformations are slow. How can I speed them up?**
```
A: Speed depends on your AI provider:

Cloud Providers (Azure, Groq):
• Check internet connection speed
• Try switching to Groq (generally faster than Azure)
• Smaller text selections process faster

Local Ollama:
• Use smaller models (Phi-3, Mistral 7B) for faster processing
• Ensure sufficient RAM (8GB minimum, 16GB recommended)
• Enable GPU acceleration if you have a compatible graphics card

Typical transformation times: 3-10 seconds depending on text length and provider.
```

**Q: I'm getting "API Error" when using cloud providers. What's wrong?**
```
A: Common causes:

1. Invalid API Key: Re-enter your API key in Settings → LLM Provider
2. Expired Subscription: Check your Azure/Groq account for active subscription
3. Rate Limits: You may have exceeded provider's rate limits (wait a few minutes)
4. Network Issues: Verify internet connection
5. Provider Outage: Check provider status pages (Azure Status, Groq Status)

Try the "Test Connection" button in Settings to diagnose the issue.
```
