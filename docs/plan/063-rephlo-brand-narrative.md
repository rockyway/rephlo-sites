## Brand Story

### The Name

**REPHLO** is a coined portmanteau that combines:
- **"Re-"**: Prefix suggesting transformation, refinement, and repetition
- **"Flow"**: The state of uninterrupted creative work; seamless movement

The name phonetically suggests "re-flow," which perfectly captures the product's essence: allowing text to flow through AI transformation without breaking the user's concentration or workflow.

### The Vision

Writing shouldn't feel like a chore. Every email, document, or message deserves clarity and polish—without the friction of switching between apps, copying text, or breaking concentration. REPHLO brings AI intelligence directly into your workflow, wherever you're writing.

### The Philosophy

Our brand is built on four core principles:

1. **Invisible Intelligence**
   AI that enhances without intruding. The best technology disappears into the background, empowering users without demanding attention.

2. **Respect Your Flow**
   Work at your pace, in your apps, with your tools. We adapt to your workflow, not the other way around.

3. **Your Voice, Refined**
   AI should amplify your intent, not replace it. Rephlo enhances your unique voice while maintaining your authentic expression.

4. **Context Everywhere**
   Intelligent AI that understands your domain, your style, and your specific needs through customizable commands and workspace organization.
